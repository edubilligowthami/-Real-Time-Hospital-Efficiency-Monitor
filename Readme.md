 A Power BI dashboard to monitor hospital operations, optimize doctor workload, and reduce patient wait times using real-time insights.

📌 Overview

Hospital management teams in both government and private hospitals face challenges in managing patient flow and resources efficiently.
Traditional Excel-based reporting is slow, manual, and error-prone, leading to inefficient decision-making and longer patient wait times.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build an interactive dashboard that enables hospital management to:

Monitor patient flow
Track doctor availability
Analyze efficiency metrics
Make data-driven decisions


-------------------------------------------
Key Features
------------------------------------------
📊 Real-time KPI monitoring
👨‍⚕️ Doctor workload tracking
⏱️ Patient wait time analysis
🏥 Department-wise insights
📍 Location-based performance analysis
🔍 Interactive filtering using slicers


 ---------------------------------
Tech Stack
----------------------------------
Excel → Data collection & preprocessing
Power BI → Dashboard & visualization
DAX → KPI calculations

Implementation
----------------------------------------------
 Development Steps
1. **Data Collection**  
   Gathered patient records, doctor schedules, and department info in Excel.  

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.  

3. **Data Import into Power BI**  
   Loaded cleaned Excel data and established relationships between tables.  

4. **Dashboard Design**  
   - KPI Cards: Patients per Doctor, Avg Wait Time, Bed Utilization.  
   - Maps: Hospital load by location (critical vs normal).  
   - Tables: Hospital efficiency metrics and performance summary.  
   - Charts: Patient distribution by location, patient trends by day/department.  

5. **DAX Measures**  
   - `Patients per Doctor = Total Patients / Total Doctors.`  
   - `Avg Wait Time = SUM(WaitTime) / COUNT(Patients)`  

6. **Interactive Slicers**  
   Enabled filtering by department, doctor, or time period for flexible analysis.

Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⚡ Reduced reporting time by 40%
📉 Reduced patient wait time
📈 Improved operational efficiency
📊 Enabled faster and better decision-making
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Impact
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Government Hospitals**  
  - Fair allocation of limited doctors → reduced overcrowding.  
  - Data‑driven reports → stronger case for staffing and funding.  

- **Private Hospitals**  
  - Efficiency gains → lower operational costs.  
  - Shorter wait times → higher patient satisfaction and reputation.  
  - Competitive advantage → attract more patients.
